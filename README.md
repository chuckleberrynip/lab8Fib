# lab8Fib
## About: 
* The program is a basic fibonnaci sequence program, where it <br> 
  shows the first given number, in this case 10, of fibonacci numbers.
## Basic structure of the program: 
* The programs starts by defining what the functions is, in this case its fib.
* After that it determine whether the number is greater than 2, and if not it, <br>
  it would list the regular order of numbers, which would be 1,1. However, <br>
  should the opposite be the case, then that means the function would call itself <br>
  and print out the necessary numbers.
#### My Experience using Guile: 
* The biggest obstacle for me is remembering the conventions of scheme, more <br>
  specifically, lisp. My takeaway from this was that maybe I am too coddled by how <br>
  C++ and Java uses a syntax that is more manageable.
* Compilation was another issue, although I found that compiling in one go, meaning <br>
  using the name of the file as a parameter rather than the convention showed by the <br> 
  GNU documentation, where you run guile and then load the file module, is much easier. <br> 
* Also, prefix < infix.
* Would I use guile again: hah, no. Or more like maybe. It was fun using guile, but <br>
  it isn't fun enough to do it on a rainy day.
